Meme Smileys
============

Meme Smileys is a silly Opera extension
([docs](http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/opera-extensions-quick-documentation-overview/))
that displays meme-style smileys on social networking sites (as of
this writing, Facebook and Twitter). The official,
[released version](https://addons.opera.com/addons/extensions/details/meme-smileys/)
is always availabe at the
[Opera extensions website](https://addons.opera.com/addons/extensions/).

It's basically an independent implementation of the same idea as
[Troll-emoticons for Facebook & Twitter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hndllphbhpadfpoikpaofkkkpkpnmjik),
a Google Chrome extension.
