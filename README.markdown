Meme Smileys
============

Meme Smileys is a silly
[Opera extension](https://addons.opera.com/addons/extensions/) that
displays meme-style smileys on social networking sites (as of this
writing, Facebook and Twitter).

It's basically an independent implementation of the same idea as
[Troll-emoticons for Facebook & Twitter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hndllphbhpadfpoikpaofkkkpkpnmjik),
a Google Chrome extension.
